				<h4 id="chicken">Chicken</h4>
				<p>
					This delicious chicken dish is exquisite and easy to prepare. The light and luscious lemon sauce really pops without being too acidic; it is simply divine. Serve it with herb-roasted potatoes or lemon-rice pilaf.

				<h4 id="beef">Beef</h4>
				<p>
				This is the chili recipe the gang eats at Purdue Boilermaker football games. I always prep and cook the chili the night before and then reheat the next day. This is a combination of many different tomato-based chili recipes. Good luck and enjoy.

				<h4 id="sushi">Sushi</h4>
				<p>
				This delicious Sushi dish is exquisite. Traditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine.Good luck and enjoy.
